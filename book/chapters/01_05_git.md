# 1.5 - Creating a Git Repository and Pushing to GitHub

In this lesson, we will set up version control for our RPG project using Git and GitHub. This is an essential skill for any programmer, as it allows you to track changes, collaborate with others, and keep your code safe.

Don't worry if you've never used Git before. I will guide you through each step, showing you exactly what commands to type and what to expect.

## What is Git and GitHub?

Before we start, let me quickly explain what these tools are:

- **Git** is a version control system that runs on your computer. It tracks changes to your code over time.
- **GitHub** is a website that hosts your Git repositories online, making it easy to share your code and collaborate with others.

Think of Git as a powerful "save" system for your code, and GitHub as a cloud storage service for those saves.

## Step 1: Check if Git is Installed

First, let's see if Git is already installed on your computer.

Open your terminal (or command prompt on Windows) and type:

```bash
git --version
```

If Git is installed, you should see something like:

```
git version 2.34.1
```

If you get an error saying that Git is not found, you'll need to install it first. Visit [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) and download the installer for your operating system.

## Step 2: Configure Git (First Time Only)

If this is your first time using Git, you need to tell it who you are. Git uses this information to track who made changes to the code.

Type these commands in your terminal, replacing the name and email with your own:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
```

You only need to do this once on your computer.

## Step 3: Navigate to Your Project Folder

Now, let's navigate to the folder where your RPG project is located.

Use the `cd` (change directory) command to move to your project folder:

```bash
cd path/to/your/rpg-project
```

For example, if your project is in a folder called `rpg_game` on your Desktop, you might type:

```bash
cd Desktop/rpg_game
```

To verify you're in the right place, you can type `ls` (on Mac/Linux) or `dir` (on Windows) to see the files in the current folder.

## Step 4: Initialize a Git Repository

Now comes the exciting part! Let's turn your project folder into a Git repository.

Type this command:

```bash
git init
```

You should see a message like:

```
Initialized empty Git repository in /path/to/your/rpg-project/.git/
```

Congratulations! Your folder is now a Git repository. Git is now ready to track changes to your files.

## Step 5: Add Your Files to Git

Right now, Git knows about your repository, but it's not tracking any files yet. Let's tell Git to track all the files in your project.

First, check which files are in your folder:

```bash
git status
```

You'll see a list of "untracked files" in red. These are files that Git sees but isn't tracking yet.

To add all files to Git, type:

```bash
git add .
```

The dot (`.`) means "add everything in this folder."

Now, if you type `git status` again, you should see the files listed in green under "Changes to be committed."

## Step 6: Make Your First Commit

A "commit" is like taking a snapshot of your project at this moment in time. Let's create our first commit.

Type this command:

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit - RPG project setup"
```

The `-m` flag lets you add a message describing what this commit contains. Always write clear, meaningful messages so you can understand your changes later.

You should see output showing that files were created and committed.

## Step 7: Create a Repository on GitHub

Now let's put our code online! Go to [github.com](https://github.com) in your web browser.

If you don't have a GitHub account yet, create one (it's free). Then sign in.

Once you're logged in:

1. Click the **+** icon in the top-right corner
2. Select **New repository**
3. Give your repository a name (for example, `rpg-game`)
4. You can add a description if you like
5. Choose **Public** (anyone can see it) or **Private** (only you can see it)
6. **Do not** check "Initialize this repository with a README" (we already have files)
7. Click **Create repository**

## Step 8: Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

GitHub will show you a page with instructions. We're interested in the section that says "…or push an existing repository from the command line."

You'll see commands similar to these (but with your username and repository name):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/rpg-game.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Let me explain what each command does:

- The first command connects your local repository to GitHub
- The second command renames your default branch to "main"
- The third command uploads your code to GitHub

Copy these commands from GitHub and paste them into your terminal, one at a time.

When you run `git push`, you may be asked for your GitHub username and password. Note that GitHub now requires a personal access token instead of your password for this step. If you haven't set one up, GitHub will guide you through the process.

## Step 9: Verify Your Code is on GitHub

Go back to your web browser and refresh your GitHub repository page. You should now see all your project files listed there!

Congratulations! Your RPG project is now safely stored on GitHub and you've taken your first steps into version control.

## What's Next?

From now on, whenever you make changes to your code, you can save those changes to Git using these three commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of what you changed"
git push
```

This is a workflow you'll use countless times as a programmer. It may feel awkward at first, but it will soon become second nature.

In the next lessons, we'll continue building our RPG engine, and you'll be committing your progress along the way. This means you'll always have a history of your work, and you can always go back to earlier versions if something breaks.

Version control is one of the most important tools in a programmer's toolkit. You're already learning to work like a professional!
