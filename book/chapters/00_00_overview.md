# Overview

In this chapter, I would like to introduce you to what you should expect from these lessons.

Though this course is not for complete beginners, still you will learn/revisit the fundamentals of programming in Python, including:

* Variables
* Data types
* Operators
* Control flow
* Functions
* Classes
* Lists
* Dictionaries
* Loops
* ... and more

I will also show you from the very beginning how to create a nice GUI for your program, using the classical Tkinter library. 

The idea here is to help you see how a programmer thinks and works, when creating a program.

We will build an open-source RPG engine, that you can easily change it later and enhance as you like. You can even transform it to your own commercial game, or a side project.

Along each set of lessons, we will follow the steps:
- Select a feature we want to implement to the game
- Introduce skills/commands to implement the feature
- Implement the feature
- Clean up the code (refactor), to make it better, if necessary.

The way I teach is not the only unique way to write programs. And it may not be the best way for you. That happens because there is almost always a "better way" of writing programs. But I want to present you with a way that works and that it applies good practices.

You may notice that some intermediary/advanced concepts may be introduced early. That will happen because certain structures will be necessary to make a good program. But try to stick closely and you will surely learn a lot about Python and programming in general.
